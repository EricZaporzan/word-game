# word-game
A simple script I whipped up to help you beat that "4 pics 1 word" puzzle game on your phone. 

## Usage

Dead stupid simple. Just use the following command (tested on Python 2.6+ and 3.x):

`python words.py <number of spaces (int)> <provided letters (str)>`

The script will spit out possible English words based on the provided word bank and the size of the word. 

## Limitations

This script really only works on English words by design â€“ the word list is in English! If someone asks me I will certainly add some rudimentary internationalization to the script.

Also, using this script makes you a cheater I guess. It's a phone game, so nobody ought to care.
